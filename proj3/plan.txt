Gitlet:
-.metadata stores: current commit SHA1
-.commits: stores previous commits

Blobs:
-Directory: .blobs
-One file serializes each blob (by SHA1)
-SHA1 constructed from name and contents of file


Commit:
-Stored in a folder with the hashID
-.metadata stores serialized commit
    -Notes: tree is serialized along with a Commit, but note that metadata runtime
    doesn't matter so we may scan in all the blobs in metadata
